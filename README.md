# licit-playground

Demonstrating use of MO-Movia/licit in an Angular application.

Note that MO-Movia/licit is still under heavy development and requires manual installation.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Proxy Info
Proxy is configured in poxy.conf.js to use port 8888 for calls that would normally go to keycloak or ems.
